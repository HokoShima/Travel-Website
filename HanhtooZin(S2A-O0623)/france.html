My mornings in France unfolded with a symphony of
delectable aromas at a charming bakery.The flaky 
perfection of croissants and the warm embrace of
a freshly baked baguette became daily rituals.
Each bite wasa journey into the heart of French 
culinary craftsmanship, a delightful start to days
filled with exploration and indulgence.

        Venturing to Grasse, the perfume capital, heightened my senses in an olfactory <br>
        adventure.Surrounded by fields of fragrant flowers, I immersed myself in the art <br>
        of perfumery. Historic perfume houses unveiled the secrets of scent creation, and <br>
        in a hands-on workshop, I crafted a bespoke fragranceâ€”a personal essence that<br>
        would forever encapsulate the spirit of this fragrant escapade.

        As the sun dipped below the Parisian skyline, the Eiffel Tower emerged <br>
        as an iconic silhouette, adorned in a cascade of evening lights. Ascending <br>
        its wrought-iron lattice, the panoramic view of the City of Lights below was <br>
        nothing short of magical. This architectural marvel became a symbol of romance,<br>
        a testament to Paris's timeless allure.Also at the season 2 of Heartstopper series,<br>
        they shoot a scene at Eiffel Tower!

            Culminating my French sojourn, the Palais Garnier unfolded its grandeur before me. <br>
            The stage was set for an evening of ballet, where graceful dancers wove tales <br>
            of elegance and passion.The opulent surroundings and the emotive movements of <br>
            the performers created an enchanting finale, leaving me with a profound appreciation <br>
            for the rich cultural tapestry that is uniquely French.<br>
